# news_categorization

The project is a machine learning application that aims to automatically categorize news headlines and content into specific categories. Within the scope of the project, news content is analyzed using text mining techniques and classified into appropriate categories (e.g. economy, politics, sports). This process makes news easier to manage and allows users to access the content they are interested in faster.

Overall, the model performed well with an accuracy of 82.34%. The best performance was observed in the sports category, while the lowest performance was observed in the world and economy categories. Precision, recall and f1-score values are balanced and consistent, indicating that the model generally makes accurate and reliable predictions.
